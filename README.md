[It's live here](https://lab.davidmoodie.com/react-leaflet-store-locator/)

I started this project to learn react and redux for the re-design and re-implementation
of Sky.com's store locator while on my placement.

While the code I publish here won't be as sky-centric as the end-product,
there might be some Sky-specific options. In general though, it should be
easy to customise this store locator to your use case. Having said this,
the API layer will definitely need to be customised for your needs.
